title: "Impute: Perception and Opportunity"
---


The marketing philosophy of Apple had three core pillars: empathy, focus and impute. Empathy and focus are talked to death in founder and VC conversations. However, one thing that people don’t often talk about is impute.

The price of a product depends not only on its intrinsic value but also on how it is perceived. The same is true for people and startups. Your ability to attract talent, capital and opportunity is shaped as much by perception as by capability.

We were taught to never judge a product by its cover. We were taught to be more substance than signalling, to not be a show off.

We were also taught to be obedient, to listen to parents, teachers and authority. We were told that a good kid does not demand much, does not fight, and stays satisfied with whatever they have. To be humble and never brag because empty vessels make the most noise.

Over time we confused humility with self erasure. We started believing that talking about our achievements or potential is arrogance.

In the real world many people with real potential are too humble to boast, while others with the same or even less ability feel proud to brag. The latter get the opportunities because they make it easy for the world to bet on them.

They understood something we did not. Perception shapes opportunity. People respond to how you present yourself long before they get a chance to know your true ability.

We often hold back because we assume it is morally wrong to show a version of ourselves that is still a work in progress. We think building our own brand and narrative is a con. But most of this hesitation comes from fear, not virtue. Fear of judgement. Fear of failure. Fear of being called out as a fraud.

If your intention is to grow and you are willing to put in the work to back up your words, there is nothing unethical about presenting your most ambitious self. It is not deception. It is a clear signal of where you intend to go. And unless there is malice in your intent, it is acceptable to miss the mark sometimes. You reset, you learn and you move forward.
