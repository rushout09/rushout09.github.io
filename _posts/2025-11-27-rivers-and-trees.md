title: "Rivers and Trees"

River's fate is to have no dignity.

Rivers originates from mighty mountains and flows into irrelevance.

It drag along whatever comes in their way as well.

Rivers lack agency, its lifeless.

Trees are full of agency and life.

They rise from the ground defying gravity.

They stand tall against the wind and the sun.

It takes years of discipline to bear any fruit or flower.

And yet once they do yield, they give it away.

The very seed of a tree is rebellion and its destiny is to give.
