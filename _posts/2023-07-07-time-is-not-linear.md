As we move faster, our perception of time tends to slow down. It is important to move fast if we want to create a substantial positive impact through our work. Just moving fast is not enough though. 

We need to move in the right direction. The choice of direction is extremely important, maybe more important than the speed itself. Moving fast in the right direction is much easier if one is guided by courage and pulled by the ambition. On the other hand, Once we are in the vicinity of a massive mass of mediocrity, it is almost impossible to escape it no matter the velocity.

Hevo is an unreasonable company built by unreasonable people. In my interactions with Sourabh, I've witnessed firsthand his ability to be unreasonably objective in assessing problems and incredibly ambitious in approaching them. Conversely, SB sets an unreasonably high bar for discipline in work. He taught me the importance of tracking, documenting, and updating people about the work one does. Lastly, there's Sarad, someone who I look up to be unreasonably confident and unafraid of solving hard problems.

As George Bernard Shaw said ”The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” I am glad that everyone I met at Hevo made me unreasonable enough to pursue what I feel is right.

The concept of time has eluded me. The last 2 years at Hevo felt like a decade long and still not long enough. It is often said that our time here is limited but I feel quite the opposite. I am incredibly grateful and fortunate to have worked with very hardworking, honest, humble, and happy peers. I have literally spent most of my nights, weekends, and early mornings with them and they have never let me feel that I don’t belong here!

As I write this, everything feels not quite normal. I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and at the same time, terrified. The truth is at this point you don't know what you feel except you know what kind of person you want to be. It's as if you've reached the unreachable and you weren't ready for it(taken from spiderman).
