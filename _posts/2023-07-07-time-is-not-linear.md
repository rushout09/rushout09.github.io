Time is not linear (nor absolute). As we move faster, it tends to slow down our perception of time (kinematic time dilation). It is important to move fast if you want to do work that has a huge positive impact because they require a great deal of time.

But just moving fast is not enough. We need to move in the right direction. The choice of direction is extremely important, maybe more important than the speed itself. Cause once we are in the vicinity of a massive mass of mediocrity, it is almost impossible to escape it no matter the speed. Even this tends to slow down our perception of time (gravitational time dilation) and might create an additional illusion of speed.

But an individual would never have enough fire to continuously move at the right velocity to cover a great distance. Hence it is important to look for the Stars (leaders). The beacons of light in the darkness of space, inspire wonder and awe.
