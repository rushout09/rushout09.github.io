title: "Reflections 2021 and Goals 2022"
---

As is said in classics, reflecting on the past leads to action in the future. The past year, as always, had exceptional results compared to the efforts I had put in and following are the things that I am most grateful for.

1. Gained and lost (thankfully) 20 Kgs.
2. Obsessively played Badminton for 6 months and then had enough of it.
3. Almost launched and spectacularly crashed a start-up.
4. Learned a bit more about business strategies, accounting, and marketing.
5. Went on 4 amazing trips.
6. Became more socially active (made an unexpectedly lot of young, smart, and happy connections (in real life as well)).
7. Got my Guitar fixed (included to make this list a little bigger).

I am excited (and terrified) to share these 7 ambitious goals for the upcoming year that I have made for myself. But before that,

Why goals? 
It is essential to have a definite aim when one takes up any in-depth study; otherwise, it is more likely that the effort will be half-hearted and incomplete. 

Why ambitious goals? 
Sometimes, it is important to have ambitious enough goals just so those small distractions cannot bother you anymore. 

Why am I sharing these goals? 
Cause it is impossible to realize personal excellence without contributing to the common interest (A shared interest in a specific subject that brings people together to form a community), as the nature we are trying to perfect is that of a rational, social animal.

What if I fail?
It is not like that I have never failed before (though it may seem so), however it would be fun to see how failing publicly looks like. Nevertheless, a little progress would be better than no progress. And who cares, letâ€™s just do this!

The goals:
1. Sports and Fitness: Build strength, endurance, and agility.
   1. Iron man half triathlon individually: 
      - 90 km cycling.
      - 2 km swimming. 
      - 21 km running. 
   2. Learn acrobatics:
       - Flips. 
       - Handsprings.
       - Handstands.
   3. 6 visible core muscles.
   4. Share at least 22 above feats on social media.
2. Software Project: Create and market an App that helps us achieve our most ambitious goals. Get at least 22 Authentic users for the app.
3. Music: Learn Vocals and classical music. Share at least 22 musical pieces on social media.
4. Get Smarter: Read at least 22 books in the following genres: Biographies, Self-Development, Programming, Marketing, non-fiction. Write Journal/Blog and Share what I learn on social media.
5. Surround me with smart, fit, creative, and happy people: Attract at least 22 new people who make me better and write about them.
6. Eat right, sleep tight and laugh often. Have at least 220 days with the right sleep, good food, and incredible stress-busting humour.
7. Saving the seventh goal for any interest or blessing that comes along the year.
