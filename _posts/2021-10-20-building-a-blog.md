title: "Setting up my blog post using Github Pages."
---





Why:

To write down ideas you had, people you met, things you built, and most importnantly why you did all these gives you a clarity of mind probably.

One another thing very important is building in public. It is a recent craze but seems legit. 

Some people were inherently good at sharing there life and making it an interesting read and others not so much.

However it is too much time consuming. However, I choose to keep it minimal and a little chaotic. 

I will try to keep a personal physical journal to write down daily stuff and try to publish a weekend blog post on the events of the week. 

As part of building in public, I will try to include things I am building in my life. 

Be it this very blog, health, wealth, projects, relationships, habits, and observations.

I do not think and do not intend to make the post more organized than it is my mind and thus saving a ton of time. Also, I think organizing stuff really takes away the original poetic essence.


It took more time than thought. I wanted to make it minimalistic so that it doesnt take much time to set it up. 

Almost all good things take a little more time to at the beginning to build a strong foundation but once it is done, it offers an infinite scaling possibility.

To be honest I was inspired by blogs of Paul Graham, sam altman, and vitalik buterin (I think he also uses same mechnism to publish his blog). 

So I just created a Github repo with MarkDown files. 

Github pages hosts the website built by jekyll build system which converts markdown files into html.

Though it is obvious that I wont be making any path-breaking observations around any of the topic mentioned above instead as it happens, most of them would be age old philosophies that we realize while doing stuff.

I have observed that poetic thoughts come to mind while doing things and not while sitting down to write. This maybe due to the fact that as I sit down to write, I try to organize and write a coherently that would be loved by the audience. That very desire sabotages the rhythm of the song.

For me, some of the best thoughts comes while running, playing, seeing new places, meeting new people, and building stuff.
